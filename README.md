# Climate Manager

## Description
A minesweeper game built around the theme of peatlands and their impact on the climate crisis. 

The goal is to build infrastructure on a planet (= uncover fields) without building on peat (=hitting mines). If a peatland is used for building (= a mine is hit) the temperature bar on the right increases as destroying peatland means destroying land of carbon capture and thus increases the temperature of the planet. 

When you used three cells of peatlands to build on, the planet cannot keep its temperature balance anymore and the game is lost. The goal is to manage the available land of the planet and build infrastructure for its inhabitants without making it loose its temperature balance by destroying peatland.

## Interactions
On left click you build (=uncover) a cell. On right click you flag a cell which could be peatland.

There are a number of bonus interactions:
* There are special well-fields. When they are uncovered you can scroll on them to get water from the ground.
* If you build on a peatland (= hit a mine) and you got water from a well before, you can blow in your microphone to cool down the planet by using the water to rewater the peatland (= the mine does not count as hit)
* You can conduct research on your planet three times by dragging over fields. This way you can check if there is peatland (= a mine) below them and whether you can built on a cell (=uncover) it safely. Each research has a maximum duration of one full second.
